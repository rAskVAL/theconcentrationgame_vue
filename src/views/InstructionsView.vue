      <h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Objective:</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards with identical pictures
        of web development tools. The player aims to find all matching pairs in
        as few turns as possible.

      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
        <li>Start with all cards face-down.</li>
        <li>Flip over any two cards in the grid.</li>
        <li>
          If the two cards turned over match (i.e., they feature the same web
          development tool), you keep the pair and take another turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the cards do not match, you must turn them back face-down in the
          same position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember the positions of cards that have been revealed to make
          matching easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue flipping pairs until all 8 pairs have been successfully
          matched.

      <p>The game ends when all 8 pairs have been successfully matched.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Scoring:</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
        <li>Each turn is counted as one move.</li>
        <li>
          Your score is the total number of moves taken to complete the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aim for the lowest possible score; fewer moves indicate better memory
          and concentration.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Tips:</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
        <li>Take your time and study the cards before making a move.</li>
        <li>
          Create a mental map of where different tools are located to speed up
          matching.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to memorize the positions of tools you&apos;ve already seen to
          avoid flipping the same cards multiple times.
